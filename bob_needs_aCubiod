Bob needs a fast way to calculate the volume of a rectangular cuboid with three values: the length, width and height of the cuboid.

Write a function to help Bob with this calculation.

this is similar to the math problem lenght * width * heigh. Just return that! see what happens

class Kata {
  static getVolumeOfCuboid(length, width, height) {
    return length * width * height;
  
  }
}
